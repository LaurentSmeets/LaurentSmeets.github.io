Gold mining has played a significant role in Ghanaâ€™s economy for centuries. Regulation of this industry has varied over time and while large-scale mining is prevalent in the country, prevalence of artisanal mining, or Galamsey has escalated throughout Ghana in recent years. These mines are not only harmful to human health due to the use of Mercury in the amalgamation process, but also leave a significant footprint on terrestrial ecosystems, degrading and destroying forested ecosystems in the region.</description>

      <description>Laurent Smeets, Peter Lugtig, Barry Schouten, CBS discussion paper (2019)
This paper shows the potential of automatic transport mode prediction in app-based surveys employing mobile device location sensors using machine learning. New relative to other studies is the use of a general population, official context of the survey, the size of the sample, the use of administrative registry data and number and types of features used.</description>

      <title>Countries Visited Animated GIF</title>

      <description>Introduction Since I am planning on using some gg_animate gifs for my thesis, it seemed like a good idea to start with a small project. This gif shows the countries I have visited thus far in order (or so I think, I haven&amp;rsquo;t gone through the photo albums yet). A lot of the code was inspired by this Github page. However, I did use the latest gg_animate grammar. Countries that I visited more than once, only show up the first time I visited them.</description>
