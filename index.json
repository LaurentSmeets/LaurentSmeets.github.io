This gif shows the countries I have visited thus far in order (or so I think, I haven\u0026rsquo;t gone through the photo albums yet). A lot of the code was inspired by this Github page. However, I did use the latest gg_animate grammar. Countries that I visited more than once, only show up the first time I visited them.\nPackages These are the R packages I used:\nlibrary(curl) library(readxl) library(data.table) library(rworldmap) library(ggplot2) library(dplyr) library(tweenr) library(ggthemes) library(rgeos) library(countrycode) library(gganimate) library(knitr) library(kableExtra)  Data I created an Excel file with all countries in the world, which can be easily found on the internet. I just used the file used in above-mentioned Github page and cleaned that. Then I added an extra column with the order of which I visited the countries. Maybe, if I feel like it, I will update it and also add dates/years later. This is how the data then looks likes:\ndf \u0026lt;- read_excel(path= \u0026quot;countries_in order.xlsx\u0026quot;, sheet=1) df%\u0026gt;% head(13)%\u0026gt;% kable()%\u0026gt;% kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c(\u0026quot;striped\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;hover\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;condensed\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;responsive\u0026quot;), full_width = F, position = \u0026quot;left\u0026quot;)    Country  visit      Burundi  NA    Comoros  NA    Djibouti  NA    Eritrea  NA    Ethiopia  NA    Kenya  12    Madagascar  NA    Malawi  NA    Mauritius  NA    Mayotte  NA    Mozambique  NA    Réunion  NA    Rwanda  45     Data manipulation First we add the ISO3 code to the data\nsetDT(df) df[, country_iso3c := countrycode(Country, 'country.name', 'iso3c')]  Now we load the map and create the data.table we need for the polygon plotting in ggplot2.\nwmap \u0026lt;- getMap() wmap \u0026lt;- spTransform(wmap, CRS(\u0026quot;+proj=robin\u0026quot;)) # reproject wmap \u0026lt;- subset(wmap, !(NAME %like% \u0026quot;Antar\u0026quot;)) # Remove Antarctica wmap_df \u0026lt;- fortify(wmap, region = \u0026quot;ISO3\u0026quot;) wmap_df \u0026lt;- left_join(wmap_df, df, by = c('id'='country_iso3c'))  In order to add a grey background, that is not influenced by the animation, I simply duplicated the data.table and added a postscript to the variable names.\nwmap_df2 \u0026lt;- wmap_df colnames(wmap_df2) \u0026lt;- paste(colnames(wmap_df2), \u0026quot;2\u0026quot;, sep = \u0026quot;_\u0026quot;)  Make the plot p \u0026lt;- ggplot() + geom_polygon(data = wmap_df, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group), fill=\u0026quot;#800000\u0026quot;)+ geom_polygon(data = wmap_df2, # this is the background map, that is not influenced by the animated part of the gif aes(x = long_2, y = lat_2, group = group_2), fill=\u0026quot;grey\u0026quot;, alpha=.3)+ theme_void() + coord_cartesian(xlim = c(-11807982, 14807978)) + transition_manual(visit)+ shadow_trail(distance = 0.01, alpha=.4) # add a small number for distance, to make all visited countries show.

In this example the linear and quadratic effect of age on PhD-delay are estimated. Users learn about the interaction between a linear and a quadratic effect in the same model, about how to think about plausible parameter spaces, and about specification of normally distributed priors for regression coefficients.
