DOI: 10.1002/essoar.10505321.1
Gold mining has played a significant role in Ghana’s economy for centuries. Regulation of this industry has varied over time and while large-scale mining is prevalent in the country, prevalence of artisanal mining, or Galamsey has escalated throughout Ghana in recent years.</description>

      <title>Automatic Travel Mode Prediction in a National Travel Survey</title>
      <link>https://LaurentSmeets.github.io/publications/cbs_discussion_paper/</link>

      <description>Laurent Smeets, Peter Lugtig, Barry Schouten, CBS discussion paper (2019)
This paper shows the potential of automatic transport mode prediction in app-based surveys employing mobile device location sensors using machine learning. New relative to other studies is the use of a general population, official context of the survey, the size of the sample, the use of administrative registry data and number and types of features used.</description>

      <title>Transport Mode Prediction from GPS Data</title>

      <description>For my Master&amp;rsquo;s thesis I worked on machine learning solutions to transport mode prediction from GPS data collected in a national travel survey. My thesis can be downloaded here. Below a little gif with the data (trips) I aimed to label. In total there were 18,414 trips of which 5,622 labelled. The prediction accuracy was 70% when distinguishing between 10 different modes.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Regression in Blavaan (Using Stan)</title>
      <link>https://LaurentSmeets.github.io/tutorials/blavaan-regression-stan/</link>

      <guid>https://LaurentSmeets.github.io/tutorials/blavaan-regression-stan/</guid>
      <description>his tutorial provides the reader with a basic tutorial how to perform a Bayesian regression in Blavaan, using Stan instead of Jags as a MCMC sampler. You can find the Blavaan Jags tutorial here. We will not delve into the the differences between Stan and Jags here (a technical explanation can be found here and a more accessible blog post here). For now it suffices to say that Stan is more efficient, especially for complex models.</description>

      <title>Countries Visited Animated GIF</title>

      <description>Introduction Since I am planning on using some gg_animate gifs for my thesis, it seemed like a good idea to start with a small project. This gif shows the countries I have visited thus far in order (or so I think, I haven&amp;rsquo;t gone through the photo albums yet). A lot of the code was inspired by this Github page. However, I did use the latest gg_animate grammar. Countries that I visited more than once, only show up the first time I visited them.</description>

      <title>Plausible Parameter Space, a R Shiny App</title>
      <link>https://LaurentSmeets.github.io/projects/pps/</link>

      <guid>https://LaurentSmeets.github.io/projects/pps/</guid>
      <description>This Shiny App is designed to help users define their priors in a linear regression with two regression coefficients. Users are asked to specify their plausible parameter space and their expected prior means and uncertainty around these means. The PhD-delay example, which is used as example in most other tutorials on this website, has been used an easy-to-go introduction to Bayesian inference. In this example the linear and quadratic effect of age on PhD-delay are estimated.</description>

      <description>This tutorial shows how you can replicate the popularity data multilevel models from the book Multilevel analysis: Techniques and applications, Chapter 2, while using different priors. In this manual the software package BRMS, version 2.3.1 for R (Windows) was used. You will be playing around with the options in BRMS to adjust the priors as opposed to using the default prior settings as we used in the BRMS Tutorial. This is part 2 of a 3 part series.</description>

No content shown here is rendered, all content is based in the template layouts/page/search.html
Setting a very low sitemap priority will tell search engines this is not important content.
